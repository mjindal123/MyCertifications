# MyCertifications
This repository contains details about my latest certifications and learning.  
Udemy : Python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp

This course contain around 149 lectures with around 23 hours of content.It would say it was refreshing for me for some of the concepts .

Course started with the basics of jupyter notebook and ended up in how we can run spark with AWS EC2 and lambda function .
The course covered almost all the ML models and touched basics of deep learning as well. Great hands on exercise with some capstone project in between.

Udemy : Machine Learning A-Z-Hands-On Python & R In Data Science.

This course contain around 294 lectures with around 42 hours of content.
This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost
