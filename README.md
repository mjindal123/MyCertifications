Udemy : Python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp

This course contain around 149 lectures with around 23 hours of content.It would say it was refreshing for me for some of the concepts .

Course started with the basics of jupyter notebook and ended up in how we can run spark with AWS EC2 and lambda function .
The course covered almost all the ML models and touched basics of deep learning as well. Great hands on exercise with some capstone project in between.
